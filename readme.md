# Professional Portfolio

Built a professional portfolio to showcase my projects and skills to future employers. 

# Task

- Present developers name, photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
- Clickable links in the navigation that goes to corresponding section.
- Developer's first application should be larger in size than the others.
- Clicking on images of applications leads them to a deployed application.
- Use media queries to provide a responsive layout that adapts to different viewports.
